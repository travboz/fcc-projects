                Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism.
                It achieves these goals without needing a garbage collector, making it useful for
                performance-critical services, embedded systems, and anywhere else fine-grained control
                over memory is needed. Rust offers powerful features to manage memory and concurrency safely
                and efficiently, significantly reducing the risk of bugs and crashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rust includes a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, from basic
                data structures to networking and concurrency. Rust's ecosystem is further enriched by Cargo,
                its package manager, and build system, which makes it easy to share and reuse libraries.
            </p>
            <p>Rust can be used for developing a variety of applications, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Command-line applications</li>
                <li>WebAssembly programs</li>
                <li>Network services</li>
                <li>Embedded devices</li>
            </ul>

            <header class="section-header">What you should already know</header>
            <p>Before diving into Rust, you should be familiar with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic concepts of programming and systems design.</li>
                <li>Some familiarity with systems programming concepts can be helpful, though not strictly necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understanding of compiled languages, though Rust can also be a first compiled language for
                    learners due to its emphasis on safety and detailed error messages.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Rust is often compared to C and C++ due to its focus on low-level systems
                programming, but it introduces novel concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and
                lifetimes to manage memory and concurrency safely. Unlike dynamically typed languages,
                Rust is statically typed and enforces a strict type system at compile time, leading to fewer runtime
                errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rust's ownership model is a unique feature that manages memory without a garbage collector,
                enabling efficient memory usage and increasing performance. The borrow checker ensures
                that references do not outlive their data, preventing common errors such as dangling pointers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rust also offers pattern matching, functional programming features, and an algebraic
                type system, distinguishing it from more traditional systems programming languages.

            <p>
                To start with Rust, install the Rust toolchain, which includes Rustc (the compiler),
                Cargo (the package manager), and Rustup (the toolchain installer). A simple "Hello, world!"
                program in Rust looks like this:
            </p>
            <code id="hello_world_code" class="code-block">fn main() {
                        <span class="code-indent">println!("Hello, world!");</span>
                    }
                </code>
            <p>
                To run this program, save it in a file with the <code class="code-inline">.rs</code> extension, then use
                Cargo to compile and run your program.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Variables_and_Mutability" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Variables and Mutability</header>
            <p>
                In Rust, variables are immutable by default. This means once a value is bound to a name, it cannot be
                changed. If you need to change a value, you can use the <code class="code-inline">mut</code> keyword.
            </p>
            <code class="code-block">let x = 5;
                    let mut y = 5;
                    y = 10; // This is allowed because y is mutable
                </code>
            <p>Rust's approach to immutability by default encourages writing code that is safe and concurrent by design.

            <header class="section-header">Data Types</header>
            <p>
                Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. It also
                has
                compound types, like tuples and arrays, to group multiple values. Rustâ€™s type system is strict, aiding
                in compile-time error checking.

            <header class="section-header">Control Flow</header>
            <p>Rust provides several control flow constructs such as <code class="code-inline">if</code>, <code
                    class="code-inline">loop</code>, <code class="code-inline">while</code>,
                and <code class="code-inline">for</code> for executing code based on conditions or for repeating code.

                Functions in Rust are declared using the <code class="inline-code">fn</code> keyword, followed by a
                name, parameters, and body. Rust functions can return values directly:
            </p>
            <code class="code-block">fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
                    <span class="code-indent">a + b // No semicolon implies this is the return value</span>

            <header class="section-header">For Loops and Iterators</header>
            <p>
                Rust's <code class="inline-code">for</code> loops work closely with iterators for efficient looping:
            </p>
            <code class="code-block">let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                    for num in numbers {
                        <span class="code-indent">println!("{}", num);</span>

        <section id="Ownership_and_Borrowing" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Ownership and Borrowing</header>
            <p>
                One of Rust's distinguishing features is its ownership system, designed to manage memory safely and
                efficiently. It eliminates common errors such as dangling pointers, double frees, and memory leaks
                without the overhead of a garbage collector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ownership is a set of rules that governs how Rust manages memory. It ensures memory safety and
                concurrency without a garbage collector. The rules are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Each value in Rust has an owner.</li>
                <li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
                <li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="Match_and_Error_Handling" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Match and Error Handling</header>
            <p>
                Rust uses pattern matching extensively, particularly in error handling. The Result
                and Option enums are used to handle situations that could result in errors or
                absence of values, making Rust programs more robust and error-resistant.
            </p>

        <section id="Option_and_Result_Types" class="main-section">
            <header class="section-header">Option and Result Types</header>
            <ul>
                <li>Option type represents an optional value: either <code class="inline-code">Some</code> value or
                    <code class="inline-code">None</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Result type is used for functions that can return an error. It returns <code
                        class="inline-code">Ok(value)</code> on success or <code class="inline-code">Err(e)</code> on
                    failure.</li>

                Rust's ownership and type system characteristics enable safe and efficient concurrency,
