                    Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism.
                    It achieves these goals without needing a garbage collector, making it useful for
                    performance-critical services, embedded systems, and anywhere else fine-grained control
                    over memory is needed. Rust offers powerful features to manage memory and concurrency safely
                    and efficiently, significantly reducing the risk of bugs and crashes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rust includes a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functionalities, from basic
                    data structures to networking and concurrency. Rust's ecosystem is further enriched by Cargo,
                    its package manager, and build system, which makes it easy to share and reuse libraries.
                </p>
                <p>Rust can be used for developing a variety of applications, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Command-line applications</li>
                    <li>WebAssembly programs</li>
                    <li>Network services</li>
                    <li>Embedded devices</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Before diving into Rust, you should be familiar with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic concepts of programming and systems design.</li>
                    <li>Some familiarity with systems programming concepts can be helpful, though not strictly necessary.</li>

                        Understanding of compiled languages, though Rust can also be a first compiled language for
                        learners due to its emphasis on safety and detailed error messages.

                <p>
                    Rust is often compared to C and C++ due to its focus on low-level systems
                    programming, but it introduces novel concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and
                    lifetimes to manage memory and concurrency safely. Unlike dynamically typed languages,
                    Rust is statically typed and enforces a strict type system at compile time, leading to fewer runtime errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rust's ownership model is a unique feature that manages memory without a garbage collector,
                    enabling efficient memory usage and increasing performance. The borrow checker ensures
                    that references do not outlive their data, preventing common errors such as dangling pointers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rust also offers pattern matching, functional programming features, and an algebraic
                    type system, distinguishing it from more traditional systems programming languages.

                <header class="section-header">Getting Started</header>
                <p>
                    To start with Rust, install the Rust toolchain, which includes Rustc (the compiler),
                    Cargo (the package manager), and Rustup (the toolchain installer). A simple "Hello, world!"
                    program in Rust looks like this:
                </p>
                <code id="hello_world_code">
                    fn main() {
                        println!("Hello, world!");
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    To run this program, save it in a file with the <code>.rs</code> extension, then use Cargo to compile and run your program.
                </p>

            <section id="Variables_and_Mutability" class="main-section">
                <header class="section-header">Variables and Mutability</header>
                <p>
                    In Rust, variables are immutable by default. This means once a value is bound to a name, it cannot be changed. If you need to change a value, you can use the <code>mut</code> keyword.
                </p>
                <code>
                    let x = 5;
                    let mut y = 5;
                    y = 10; // This is allowed because y is mutable
                </code>
                <p>Rust's approach to immutability by default encourages writing code that is safe and concurrent by design.</p>

            <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
                <header class="section-header">Data Types</header>
                <p>
                    Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. It also has
                    compound types, like tuples and arrays, to group multiple values. Rustâ€™s type system is strict, aiding
                    in compile-time error checking.
                </p>

            <section id="Control_Flow" class="main-section">
                <header class="section-header">Control Flow</header>
                <p>Rust provides several control flow constructs such as <code>if</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>,
                    and <code>for</code> for executing code based on conditions or for repeating code.</p>

            <section id="Ownership_and_Borrowing" class="main-section">
                <header class="section-header">Ownership and Borrowing</header>
                <p>
                    One of Rust's distinguishing features is its ownership system, designed to manage memory safely and
                    efficiently. It eliminates common errors such as dangling pointers, double frees, and memory leaks
                    without the overhead of a garbage collector.
                </p>

            <section id="Match_and_Error_Handling" class="main-section">
                <header class="section-header">Match and Error Handling</header>
                <p>
                    Rust uses pattern matching extensively, particularly in error handling. The Result
                    and Option enums are used to handle situations that could result in errors or
                    absence of values, making Rust programs more robust and error-resistant.
                </p>

                <header class="section-header">Concurrency</header>
                <p>
                    Rust's ownership and type system characteristics enable safe and efficient concurrency,
                    allowing you to write programs that perform multiple tasks at the same time without data
                    races or other common concurrency problems.
